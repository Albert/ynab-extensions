ynab-extensions
===============

YNAB (<http://www.youneedabudget.com>) is a great budgeting software that I've been using for almost a year. However, as I am a big fan of graphs, I'm interested in complementing YNAB's functionality with more varied reporting. 

ynab-extensions is a web application that imports budgets and registers exported from YNAB as csv files. It displays several types of charts and some statistics on the input. 

Here are some of the supported reports. 

Progress towards current budget allocations for a given month:
